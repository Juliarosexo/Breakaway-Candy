        <h2>About Fareed Ray</h2>
        <p>Meet Fareed Ray: a relentless entrepreneur, devoted father, and visionary CEO of Breakaway Enterprises. Fareed is also an author who has overcome the odds. After starting his journey in prison, he discovered his passion for making candy and quickly turned it into a thriving business. With the overwhelming success of his Jailhouse Lollipops, he was able to sustain his clothing line and is now expanding his candy brand, proving that prison walls do not define his future. Fareed is not stopping anytime soon!</p>
        <p>His mindset and several misconceptions he chose or grew up to believe caused a lot of his downfalls in life, one of which was a 21-year prison sentence. But one day, Fareed woke up with a desire to right his wrongs and help others, especially the youth, avoid the same mistakes by changing perceptions.</p>
